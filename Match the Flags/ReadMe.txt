The user will have to click on the correct location of the country to match it with the flag given to get a point (choose continent then country). 
There are 5 lives and three hints per flag, Every time a hint is used, a life will be lost.So there are 5 hints in total.
The show grid button will help the  user to use the hint example (It's in the north means the country is above the line)
There's a pause button to pause the game and choose to continue or exit the game.
The game ends when the user runs out of time and the high score will be recorded and then displayed on the main menu.
